## Expo CLI Quickstart

* [`expo-cli`](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli)
  * [npmjs/expo-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-cli)
  * [Website](https://expo.io/)
  * [Documentation](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/expo-cli/)

Assuming that you have [Node 10 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or greater installed, you can use `npm` to install the Expo CLI command line utility:

```bash
$ npm install --global expo-cli
# or shorthand
$ npm i -g expo-cli
# verify installation
$ expo --version
```

Then run the following commands to create a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject":

```bash
expo init AwesomeProject

cd AwesomeProject
npm start # you can also use: expo start
```

This will start a development server for you.

## React Native CLI Quickstart

Requires:

* `NodeJS` 8.3 or newer
* `Python2`
* `JDK8`
* [`Android Studio`](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
  * Android SDK
  * Android SDK Platform

### Create a New Application

React Native has a built-in command line interface, which you can use to generate a new project. You can access it without installing anything globally using `npx`, which ships with Node.js. Let's create a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject":

```bash
npx react-native init AwesomeProject
```

Run `npx react-native run-android` inside your React Native project folder:

```bash
cd AwesomeProject
npx react-native run-android
```
